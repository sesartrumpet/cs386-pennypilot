## 1. Activity Summary
Describe what each individual has contributed to the project in the last week.  Provide some supporting documentation (e.g., an issue number, commit id, corresponding meeting date, etc.).  If someone didn't do anything, please be honest and explain why. Activity that advances your project toward completion is expected every week and should be reflected in your Git repository!

## 2. Retrospective
In your weekly meeting, you should spend a few minutes discussing how the group is functioning. What aspects of the group dynamics contribute to the success of the project? In addition, raise any issues—best done directly but with humor and kindness—that you believe are interfering with the effectiveness of the group and your ability to complete the project on time.

The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make five lists:

1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members
2. Successes: what went well
3. Failures: what did not go well
4. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
5. What we should try next time.

### Our Retrospective
1. Appreciations
- **Victor** consistently showed initiative and leadership, especially during critical restructuring and polishing stages.  
- **Kyle** and **Sesar** provided a solid foundation by setting up and integrating the database, which helped the team move faster.  
- Team members showed flexibility by contributing across various areas despite evolving requirements.

2. Successes
- We successfully pivoted and restructured the entire application to align with the new project direction.  
- Multiple components (frontend, backend, and database) were integrated smoothly and tested on time by **Elijah**.  
- Strong collaboration between frontend and backend helped us ship a functional MVP for Deliverable 4.

3. Failures
- Coordination was difficult at times due to inconsistent meeting attendance and communication gaps.  
- We underestimated the time required for integration and final polish, which led to some last-minute work.

4. Barriers
- Team scheduling conflicts made it difficult to have full participation in work sessions.  
- Initial unfamiliarity with MySQL and tkinter created a steep learning curve that delayed development in the early stages.  
- Some pull requests were merged late due to lack of immediate reviews.

5. What We Should Try Next Time
- Set fixed weekly work sessions with required attendance to avoid bottlenecks.  
- Break large tasks into smaller GitHub issues to distribute work more evenly.  
- Assign reviewers ahead of time for each pull request to ensure quick turnarounds.  
- Maintain better version control discipline (e.g., consistent branching and PR etiquette).
