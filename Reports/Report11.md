## 2. Retrospective
In your weekly meeting, you should spend a few minutes discussing how the group is functioning. What aspects of the group dynamics contribute to the success of the project? In addition, raise any issues—best done directly but with humor and kindness—that you believe are interfering with the effectiveness of the group and your ability to complete the project on time.

The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make five lists:

1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members
2. Successes: what went well
3. Failures: what did not go well
4. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
5. What we should try next time.

### Our Retrospective
1. Appreciations
- Team members were responsive to code review requests
- Good collaboration on fixing database-related issues
- Clear communication about implementation changes

2. Successes
- Successfully fixed trip table structure and date handling
- Improved code documentation significantly
- Enhanced user experience with real-time updates
- Better error handling implementation

3. Failures
- Initial database schema issues caused some delays
- Some type conversion issues needed multiple iterations to fix

4. Barriers
- Coordinating database changes across different features
- Managing date format consistency across the application

5. What We Should Try Next Time
- More thorough schema planning before implementation
- Better type handling strategy from the start
- More frequent code reviews for complex changes
