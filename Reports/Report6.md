Describe what each individual has contributed to the project in the last week.  Provide some supporting documentation (e.g., an issue number, commit id, corresponding meeting date, etc.).

## 2. Retrospective
In your weekly meeting, you should spend a few minutes discussing how the group is functioning. What aspects of the group dynamics contribute to the success of the project? In addition, raise any issues—best done directly but with humor and kindness—that you believe are interfering with the effectiveness of the group and your ability to complete the project on time.

The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make five lists:

1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members
2. Successes: what went well
3. Failures: what did not go well
4. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
5. What we should try next time.

### Our Retrospective
1. Kyle did a great job on the diagrams for D3 and most of team is working together well
2. Our group meeting to work on deliverable 3 and midterm presentation  
3. None for now besides the issue below
4. Not having 100% attendance in our weekly meetings  
5. Better communication from team members if they will be missing
