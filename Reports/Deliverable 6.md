**Introduction**    

PennyPilot is a personal finance management tool designed for students planning to study abroad. The application helps users calculate savings goals based on their trip
timeline and location, offering personalized daily, weekly, and monthly savings targets. Users input their destination, trip date, and current savings to receive 
actionable insights and visual feedback to stay on track.

The system connects to a MySQL database to retrieve and update trip data, tracks savings over time, and dynamically updates charts using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter for GUI and 
Matplotlib for visualization. With a strong focus on usability and clarity, PennyPilot simplifies financial planning and motivates users to achieve their study-abroad 
goals.
