# Description
Penny Pilot is a desktop GUI application built with Python, Tkinter, and MySQL,  
designed to help students plan and track savings for study abroad trips.  
The system focuses on simplicity by only asking for three key inputs: destination,  
current savings, and trip timeline. Once all three fields are filled out,  
the interface transitions to a dedicated “Progress Screen” where users can monitor  
and update their savings over time. The savings goal is automatically calculated  
based on the location and timeline, and a visual breakdown is shown to help users  
stay on track. 
When the user reopens the app, they are brought directly to the Progress Screen  
to continue updating their savings. Whenever savings are updated, both the savings  
breakdown and goal chart dynamically reflect the new data to provide real-time  
feedback. This ensures users can clearly see how their progress has changed and  
what remains to be saved. Only if the user decides to change trip details—such  
as the destination or timeline—does the app return to the initial “Select Trip”  
screen. This streamlined design keeps the user focused on goal progress while  
minimizing distractions, aligning with Penny Pilot’s mission to make trip planning  
straightforward and motivating.
