## 1. Activity Summary
Describe what each individual has contributed to the project in the last week.  Provide some supporting documentation (e.g., an issue number, commit id, corresponding meeting date, etc.).  If someone didn't do anything, please be honest and explain why. Activity that advances your project toward completion is expected every week and should be reflected in your Git repository!

## 2. Retrospective
In your weekly meeting, you should spend a few minutes discussing how the group is functioning. What aspects of the group dynamics contribute to the success of the project? In addition, raise any issues—best done directly but with humor and kindness—that you believe are interfering with the effectiveness of the group and your ability to complete the project on time.

The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make five lists:

1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members
2. Successes: what went well
3. Failures: what did not go well
4. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
5. What we should try next time.

### Our Retrospective
1. Appreciations: The team has been working really well considering the pivot to a trip finance planner and to a new programming language.
2. Successes: The whole team was excited about the new project and is eager to begin working.
3. Failures: Some of the team members have had a more hectic than usual schedule and have not been as communicative as normal. 
4. Barriers: Waiting for everyone to get set up with new technologies that are required for the new project.
5. What we should try next time: We still have not implemented a CLickUp tasks manager. We think it would be beneficial for keeping everyone accountable.
