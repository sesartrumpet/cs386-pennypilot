## 2. Roles

As described in the “Team Project Instructions” document, there are four roles (manager, quality assurance, reporter, and presenter), and everyone should rotate through these roles at least once. Each member of the group should have no more than one role per week unless your team has less than four active members. On top of these roles, every member is expected to work on coding and writing the project deliverables. After everyone has rotated through the roles at least once, the group can decide to keep rotating or to assign permanent roles to specific team members.

**Roles for this week:**
- **Scrum Master:** Elijah Sprouse
- **Product Owner:** Kyle Radzvin
- **Archivist:** Sesar Parra

## 3. Meeting Schedule

You should have in-person weekly meetings starting in the 2nd week of classes until reading week (see the Course Schedule on Canvas). Most project deliverables are due on Sunday, thus, meeting near the end of the week can be an opportunity to work together to wrap up the documents and plan for the following week.

- **Recurring Meeting:** Saturdays @ 5 PM – 6 PM  
- **Potential Secondary Meeting:** Play by ear based on work schedule (smaller team meetings as needed).
