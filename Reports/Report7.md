## 1. Activity Summary
Describe what each individual has contributed to the project in the last week.  Provide some supporting documentation (e.g., an issue number, commit id, corresponding meeting date, etc.).  If someone didn't do anything, please be honest and explain why. Activity that advances your project toward completion is expected every week and should be reflected in your Git repository!

Victor:  
- Redid UML use case diagram for presentation
- Presented functional requirements for midterm


Manjot:  


Elijah:  
- Completed retrospective

Kyle:  
- Presented midterm update of project

Sesar:  


Vikram:  

## 2. Retrospective
In your weekly meeting, you should spend a few minutes discussing how the group is functioning. What aspects of the group dynamics contribute to the success of the project? In addition, raise any issues—best done directly but with humor and kindness—that you believe are interfering with the effectiveness of the group and your ability to complete the project on time.

The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make five lists:

1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members
2. Successes: what went well
3. Failures: what did not go well
4. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
5. What we should try next time.

### Our Retrospective
1. Appreciations: Many people stepped up for certain difficult aspects of the presentation.
2. Successes: Presentation went smoothly, and many people contributed.
3. Failures: Not every member was able to contribute unfortunately.
4. Barriers: Communication, or lack thereof, seems to be limiting the progress of the project.
5. We are going to try meeting in-person more often starting after spring break to get more progress on the project.
