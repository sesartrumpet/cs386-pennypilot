# System Description
Provide a brief textual description of your system. The first paragraph of the description must contain the problem statement, the product position statement, and the value proposition of your system (you can refine/update what you presented in D.2). The following paragraphs should describe the key requirements of the system. This description should be consistent with D.2 stakeholders, requirements, use cases, and user stories. Again, refinements/updates are welcome since your understanding of the system is constantly evolving. 

Use Bold every time that you use a noun that is a class in your model. Use Italic every time that you use a noun that is an attribute in your model. Use Bold and Italic every time that you use a noun or verb that is an association in your model. 

Grading criteria (5 points): The description should be clear, concise, and well-written, free of typos and grammar problems. The use of bold, italic, and underline should be coherent with the model presented in Section 2---all classes, attributes, and associations from the model should appear in the text and their role in the system, as described in the text, should be consistent with the model.  

Model
Provide the conceptual model of your system as a UML class diagram. Represent proper cardinalities (multiplicities) for all associations. Also include the association names.
